Introduction
------------
This is the repository of scripts written in the Pate group at the
University of Virginia. These scripts contain useful functionality
for assisting in certain routine activities for broadband rotational
spectroscopy. It also includes the official experimental repository 
for Autofit, a collaboration between UVa and Steve Shipman of
New College of Florida and Ian Finneran of Caltech. 

Authorship
----------
Authorship varies, but most were created by Cristobal Perez,
Nathan Seifert, and Daniel Zaleski. Although inconsistent, 
authorship is commonly located in the header of each script.
The vast majority of authorship for the Autofit scripts is attributed
to Steve Shipman and Ian Finneran.

Support
-------
Any questions regarding this repository, or the Python scripts contained within,
We can be directed towards Nathan Seifert (nas3xf[at]virginia[dot]edu). 
 We do not guarantee this code will work on any Python-containing platform, since this is
not a professional venture nor are we Python professionals, but we are  happy to help support 
(or at least attempt support) of any issues you might have.
