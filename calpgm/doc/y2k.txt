This software suite is a 'c' console application that has been compiled and 
tested under a Y2K compliant version of  Microsoft Visual C for Windows 98 
and under gnu gcc compilers for Windows 95/98, LINUX and UNIX.

Dates and times are not used in the calculation, but system routines are 
called to provide date and time information on several output files.  
The dates and times are for informational purposes and do not interfere 
with the operation of the program.  The accuracy of this date and time 
information are dependent on the Y2K compliance of the system on which the 
software is compiled or run.
