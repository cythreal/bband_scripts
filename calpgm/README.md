CALPGM Source Code
==================

Contents of this folder
-----------------------
This is a mirror of the source code CALPGM program suite developed by Herb Pickett, formerly of JPL. 
These files are originally available at the JPL Molecular Spectroscopy website, which can be found at http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov

For citing these programs, the following citation is appropriate:
H. M. Pickett, J. Mol. Spectrosc., 148, 371 (1991).

Licensing
---------
These source files are used for educational, non-commercial use only. 
Since we provide the binaries for SPCAT and SPFIT along with Autofit (i686/x86-64 for Linux, and 32-bit for Windows), it is naturally appropriate under such open source licenses as GPLv2 to also provide the source code.

 No modifications to the SPCAT/SPFIT code have been made, and the source files provided in this folder are exact copies of those found on the JPL website. 

Modification of the CALPGM code is not authorizable by the maintainers of this Github repository, and any interested party should contact the authors/maintainers of this code at JPL if you are interested in modifying or using this code in other contexts besides non-commercial use with Autofit or any of the scripts provided here.

If you are a maintainer of this code or the executor of the license, and you find it inappropriate for the hosting of these source files on this Github repository, please contact us (admin: Nathan Seifert, email: nas3xf[at]virginia[dot]edu). We will be happy to remove it.
