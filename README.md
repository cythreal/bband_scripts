Introduction
------------
This is the repository of scripts written in the Pate group at the
University of Virginia. These scripts contain useful functionality
for assisting in certain routine activities for broadband rotational
spectroscopy. It also includes the official experimental repository 
for Autofit, a collaboration between UVa and Steve Shipman of
New College of Florida and Ian Finneran of Caltech. 

Authorship
----------
Authorship varies, but most were created by Cristobal Perez,
Nathan Seifert, and Daniel Zaleski. Although inconsistent, 
authorship is commonly located in the header of each script.
The vast majority of authorship for the Autofit scripts is attributed
to Steve Shipman and Ian Finneran.

Organization 
------------
This repository contains three folders. 

One is entitled "workup"; these are primarily scripts created by various members of the Pate
group for the purpose of common broadband data workup and other routine
activities. You can find more info about a given script in the header
of the script. 

The second is entitled "autofit". This is the most actively
updated folder on the repository, so don't be surprised if you notice it's a 
huge mess. There is another README for autofit in that folder with more
information regarding the contents.

The third is entitled "calpgm". This is a mirror of the CALPGM source code, developed by Herb Pickett, that is available on JPL's website. No modifications have been made with respect to the versions available on the JPL website. For more information, read the README in the "calpgm" directory.

Any questions regarding this repository, or the Python scripts contained within,
We can be directed towards Nathan Seifert (nas3xf[at]virginia[dot]edu). 
 We do not guarantee this code will work on any Python-containing platform, since this is
