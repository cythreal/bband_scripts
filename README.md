This is the repository of scripts written in the Pate group at the
University of Virginia. These scripts contain useful functionality
for assisting in certain routine activities for broadband rotational
spectroscopy.  

Authorship varies, but most were created by Cristobal Perez,
Nathan Seifert, and Daniel Zaleski. Although inconsistent, 
authorship is commonly located in the header of each script.

Any questions regarding this repository can be directed towards
Nathan Seifert (nas3xf[at]virginia[dot]edu). We do not guarantee
this code will work on any Python-containing platform, but we are 
happy to help support (or at least attempt support) of any issues 
you might have.
